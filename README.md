# Community Event Finder Web Application
This platform's main goal is to revolutionize how people find, interact with, and share local communities through events. The platform fosters a sense of community spirit and belonging by providing users with a carefully selected selection of events that align with their interests and locality through its hyper-local approach. This ecosystem is further enhanced by the addition of a Marketplace for Event Services, which offers vital resources and connections to enable the smooth planning and implementation of events. The goal of this dual emphasis on finding local events and helping event organizers is to create a lively, connected community where all events, no matter how big or small, are celebrated and easily accessible.

In addition to establishing a link between locals and the cultural center of their neighborhoods, the objective is to give local businesses and community organizers the support and visibility they require to succeed. With the help of this platform, we hope to create a community where support and involvement are freely given, leading to the development of local events as the focal point of enjoyment and community building.

Unlike Eventbrite and similar large platforms, our app places a strong emphasis on hyper-local events, ensuring even the smallest community gatherings gain visibility, and integrates a unique Marketplace for Event Services, directly connecting event organizers with local service providers to streamline event planning and bolster local economies.
